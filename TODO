TODO items for gmuck, in no particular order.

o Enable tests.
o Implement more-than-one-line checks, in order to provide more context.
o Better XML checks.
o Non-nitpick mode?
o WWW pointers for reported errors.
o Deprecated attributes checks should maybe contain also non-standard ones
  and other common troublesome ones, like <body margin(width|height)>,
  <table height>.
