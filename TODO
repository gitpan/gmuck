TODO items for gmuck, in no particular order.

o Enable tests.
o Implement more-than-one-line checks, in order to provide more context.
o Better XML checks.
o Non-nitpick mode?
o WWW pointers for reported errors.
o Deprecated attributes checks should maybe contain also non-standard ones
  and other common troublesome ones, like <body margin(width|height)>,
  <table height>.
o Check the wicked piece of regexp in the start of the
  "non-lowercase attribute" test in &_attributes, and adapt it to others.
o Check for ID,NAME,IDREF,IDREFS attributes (see SPECS).
o See the XHTML spec for ID,NAME and the like in SPECS.
o Check for the "all elements but ..." stuff in SPECS' fixed-valued attributes.
