Welcome to gmuck!

  gmuck assists you in producing valid (X)HTML by checking CGI scripts,
  XSL stylesheets, templates, normal HTML files or [you name it] and
  reporting errors that it finds.

  It is not a replacement for real validation tools, but is handy in
  quick checks and in situations where validation of the actual generated
  markup is troublesome.

  gmuck is a line-oriented tool.  Because of that, its structural
  checking capabilities are limited, but it makes an attempt to report
  syntactical errors as well as provides some lint-like features.

  There gmuck distribution consists of the "HTML::GMUCK" module and the
  "gmuck" command line interface to it.

  See the gmuck(1) and HTML::GMUCK(3) manual pages
  (or before installation, "perldoc bin/gmuck.pod" and
  "perldoc lib/HTML/GMUCK.pod" in the dir where you unpacked gmuck),
  and ChangeLog, TODO and BUGS files for more information.

  gmuck is short for Generated MarkUp ChecKer, or Generated MUCK if you
  like.  Hmph, that's actually ambiguous, see above for a better explanation.
  But gmuck sounds cool :)

DEPENDENCIES

  gmuck should work with Perl 5.6.0 and later.  The development and
  most of the testing has been done with Perl 5.6.1, 5.8.0 and 5.8.3 
  on Linux.  If you encounter problems,  please report them, preferably
  with a suggested fix (see FEEDBACK).

  gmuck is written in pure Perl, so no C requirements.  Also, all
  platforms that Perl works on should be supported.
