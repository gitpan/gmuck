Welcome to gmuck!

  gmuck assists you in generating valid (X)HTML by examining the
  source code that generates it.

  It is not a replacement for real validation tools, but is handy in
  quick checks and in situations where validation of the actual markup
  is troublesome.

  gmuck is a line-oriented tool.  Because of that and other fundamental
  reasons, it will not check the structure of your markup, but makes an
  attempt to report syntactical errors as well as provides some
  lint-like capabilities.

  There gmuck distribution consists of the "HTML::GMUCK" module and the
  "gmuck" command line interface to it.

  gmuck is short for Generated MarkUp ChecKer, or Generated MUCK if you
  like.

  See the gmuck(1) and HTML::GMUCK(3) manual pages
  (or before installation, "perldoc bin/gmuck.pod" and
  "perldoc lib/HTML/GMUCK.pod" in the dir where you unpacked gmuck),
  and ChangeLog, TODO and BUGS files for more information.


DEPENDENCIES

  gmuck should work with Perl 5.00503 and later.  The development and
  most of the testing is done with Perl 5.6.1 on Linux.
  If you encounter problems,  please report them, preferably with a
  suggested fix (see FEEDBACK).

  gmuck is written in pure Perl, so no C requirements.  Also, all
  platforms that Perl works on should be supported.

  HTML::Tagset (version 3.03 or newer) is required.

  Regex::PreSuf is recommended, but not required.  Systems with it
  will see a slight performance gain in most checks.


INSTALLATION

   Installation goes the normal way:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


AVAILABILITY

  gmuck's home page is at <URL:http://gmuck.sourceforge.net/>.
